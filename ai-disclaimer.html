<h1>AI Statement</h1>

<p>
    It is my belief that users want transparency about content that was produced by AI. To that end, I have started being transparent about when and how I use AI in my creation process.
</p>

<p>Here are some steps that I have taken to preserve transparency.</p>

<ul>
    <li>I call out specific instances of AI genrated content such as tables and lists.</li>
    <li>I title all of my AI genrated images with "AI Generated Graphic - &lt;AI Provider&gt;".</li>
    <li>I fact check AI when I use it for research.</li>
    <li>I label my posts with an AI disclaimer and a link to this page.</li>
    <li>I added a meta tag following this <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9479">proposal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of AI disclaimers in use on this site:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Created by Jim Smits and ChatGPT</li>
    <li>Created by Jim Smits, Edited with ChatGPT, Scripts by ChatGPT</li>
    <li>Created by Jim Smits, Edited with ChatGPT</li>
    <li>Created by Jim Smits, Researched with ChatGPT, Scripts by ChatGPT</li>
    <li>Created by Jim Smits, Researched with ChatGPT</li>
    <li>Not Created By AI</li>
    <li>Scripts Generated By ChatGPT</li>
</ul>
