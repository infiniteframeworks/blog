So, you've invested in an e-commerce add-on for a platform like Wix or Squarespace. Online orders are coming in, and you're reaching markets in other states—a real win!

But there’s one default setting that could quietly cost you sales and send potential customers straight to your competitors: the promo code box.
The Customer Experience

Put yourself in the buyer’s shoes:

 - They find something they love on your site.
 - They click "Add to Cart" and begin checkout.
 - Suddenly, they see it—a small, unassuming promo code box.

This tiny field sparks doubt. “Am I getting the best deal?” they wonder.

## The Risk

Here’s what often happens next:

 - They open a new tab and search for “[Your Store Name] promo code.”
 - Best case: they don’t find anything and feel mildly disappointed.
 - Worst case: they see an ad from your competitor and decide to buy there instead.

You’ve just lost a sale—and handed it to the competition.

## The Solution

You have two smart options:

 - Lean into it: If you’re going to offer promo codes, make sure they’re easy to find and helpful to both you and your customer.
 - Turn it off: If you’re not running promotions, disable the field to avoid confusion and second-guessing.
