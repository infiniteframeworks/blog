There is an archaic saying **"Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM."**

Back in the mid 20th century, IBM was the safe bet in enterprise IT. Not the cheapest. Not the most innovative. But reliable, reputable, and most importantly: if things blew up, you wouldn’t get blamed. You chose the giant. The industry leader.

It’s a phrase soaked in risk aversion, corporate politics, and brand trust as a CYA strategy. 

This mindset didn’t die with the mainframe. It just changed logos.

Today, the same impulse shows up in choices like buying AWS over DigitalOcean, choosing Salesforce over a leaner CRM, or going all-in on Microsoft 365. The instinct is the same: opt for the “safe” brand, not because it's better—but because it's defensible.

That’s the hidden cost of institutional risk aversion: decisions made to avoid blame, not create value.

It raises the question:
Are we optimizing for outcomes—or alibis?
