So I touched on this a while ago, but kind of forgot about it, but I think it's a handy skill that I have not heard to many people (if any) talk about.  It's super easy (with some coaxing) to get ChatGPT to generate a compressed Obsidian notebook about any given topic really. 

I first tried Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I asked for:

> Generate a cross linked obsidian notebook about fear and loathing in las vegas. Write it and zip it up for me.

The first response was a zip with cross linked markdown files, but many of the links were just stubs. With a little cajoling, it filled out the missing markdown files.

Then I told it:

> that's a really valuable skill - being able to produce a markdown explainer of a given concept. Can you remember that as a skill that you can use when a give prompt merits such a response? Let's name the skill Obsidify.

Now when I am chatting I can ask it to obsidify a given topic. 

Caveat emptor. I have had to coax it along a few times to get the desired output, but overall I am happy and impressed with how well it performs.
