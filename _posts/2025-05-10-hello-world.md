If you've written any code before, you've probably seen this phrase:

# Hello, World

Itâ€™s the traditional first program in just about every programming language. Simple, unassuming, and universal. 

In JavaScript:

```
console.log("Hello, World")
```

The tradition dates back to 1974, when Brian Kernighan used it in a C tutorial in the early days of UNIX. 

So here it is: the inaugural post of _and beyond_.

Hello, World!
