Google Business Profile (GBP)—still often called _Google My Business_—is arguably the single most important thing to set up when you’re targeting local customers for a brick-and-mortar store, restaurant, or clinical practice.

People lean on Google’s rich results (the “Local Pack,” map listings, Knowledge Panels) to decide where to go and whom to trust. Consider your profile the **first impression**: photos, reviews, services, hours, and quick actions (call, directions, book) all live here.

Say someone searches **“ocd therapist near me.”** Your website may appear—but your **Business Profile** is what the searcher actually taps: photos of your space, a short description that builds confidence, review snippets, and an easy “Call” or “Book” button. This is where you stand out.
