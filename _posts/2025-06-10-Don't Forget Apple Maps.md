**TL;DR:** Don't sleep on Apple Maps. It's free, fast, and may be the missing link between your business and a local iPhone user who's ready to buy.

It's a pattern I see again and again.  A healthy local result in Google Maps, but zero results in Apple Maps, or worse, a link to your competition.

While it is [difficult to measure](https://www.justinobeirne.com/how-many-people-use-google-maps-compared-to-apple-maps?utm_source=chatgpt.com), the general consensus is that 33% percent of iPhone users use Apple Maps regularly. So what does listing on Apple Maps mean for a small business in a city of 75,000 people? Let's run some hypotheticals. 

üßÆ Estimated Apple Maps Reach in a City of 75,000
Step 1: Device & App Usage Estimates

- ~60% have smartphones ‚Üí 45,000
- ~50% are iPhone users ‚Üí 22,500
- ~33% of those use Apple Maps regularly ‚Üí ~7,500 active Apple Maps users

üìç Local Discovery Behavior (Industry Averages)

- Let‚Äôs say 1% of local Apple Maps users discover your business monthly ‚Üí ~75 visits/month
- 76% visit within 24 hours ‚Üí ~57 foot traffic visits/month
- 28% of those convert to a sale ‚Üí ~16‚Äì17 new customers/month

üí∞ Why It Matters

Even in a small city, Apple Maps visibility could bring in 15‚Äì20 new customers monthly ‚Äî for free ‚Äî just by showing up in the right place.

This compounds over time, especially if:

- You add hours, photos, and categories
- You collect positive reviews (via Yelp/TripAdvisor)
- You‚Äôre in a high-foot-traffic category (like food, retail, services)

### Why Apple Maps Still Matters

Apple Maps powers **millions of searches daily**‚Äînot just on iPhones, but across Siri, Safari, Apple Watch, and even some third-party apps. In fact:

- **Every iPhone** comes with Apple Maps pre-installed.    
- Siri uses Apple Maps to answer location-based queries.    
- Apple CarPlay relies on it for directions.    
- Many users never install Google Maps.    

### The Fix: It's Free and Takes 10 Minutes
