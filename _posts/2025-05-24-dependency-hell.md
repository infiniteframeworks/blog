**Dependency Hell** is what happens when your project relies on too many external libraries—and they start fighting each other.

Conflicts, version mismatches, and fragile upgrades turn simple changes into chain reactions. One update breaks five things. You spend hours debugging code you didn’t write and can’t change.

It was common in the .NET WebForms era (hello, DLL Hell), but still shows up today in modern stacks. Better tools help, but complexity just shifted.

**Avoid it by:**

- Pinning versions    
- Auditing regularly    
- Keeping builds clean    
- Using containers    
- Being selective with libraries    

Dependencies are a shortcut—until they’re not.
