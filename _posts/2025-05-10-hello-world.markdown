# Hello, World

If you've written any code before, you've probably seen this phrase:

# Hello, World!

It’s the traditional first program in just about every programming language. Simple, unassuming, and universal—it’s the digital equivalent of testing the mic. Just enough to prove the system works.

```
console.log("Hello, World")
```

The tradition dates back to 1972, when Brian Kernighan used it in a C tutorial in the early days of UNIX. It later appeared in the legendary book _The C Programming Language_ by Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, and it stuck. Decades later, we’re still using it—part ritual, part rite of passage.

So here it is: the inaugural post of _and beyond_.

This blog is where I’ll share ideas, experiments, and technical breadcrumbs from my journey building Infinite Frameworks (and helping others build theirs). Topics will likely orbit around web development, small business strategy, and wherever curiosity leads next.

If you're here, welcome. If you're returning, thanks for coming back.

Let’s see where this goes.
