If your checkout page feels like an antique cash register, the problem might be the code â€” outdated markup and sluggish scripts that frustrate today's mobile-first shoppers.

# The Hidden Cost of Outdated Websites
- **Slow load times** increase bounce rates
- **Confusing UX** leads to lost sales
- **Insecure or deprecated scripts** create browser errors and trust issues
- **Poor mobile optimization** alienates a large portion of your audience

# My Approach

When I rebuild storefronts, I start by auditing the code. 

1. **Code Audit** - I check the markup to identify performance bottlenecks.
2. **Modernization** - I strip out the bloat and optimize for speed and mobile first readiness.
3. **Optimize for Conversions**- I streamline the flow so you customer can checkout fast with zero hesitation.

The result? Your customers glide from _"Add to Cart"_ to _"Order Complete"_ without friction.
