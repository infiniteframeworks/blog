The **Big Ball of Mud** is a term used in software architecture to describe a system with no clear structure. It’s a haphazard, sprawling codebase that's been patched and extended over time without a coherent design. The term was coined in the paper _"[Big Ball of Mud](https://hillside.net/plop/plop97/Proceedings/foote.pdf)"_ by Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder in 1997.

### Core Characteristics:

- **Lack of clear architecture:** There are no well-defined layers, modules, or separation of concerns.    
- **High coupling, low cohesion:** Everything depends on everything else.    
- **Hard to understand, maintain, or extend:** New features or bug fixes are risky and often break unrelated parts.    
- **Grows organically:** Often the result of short-term decisions, quick fixes, and deadline pressure.    

### Why it happens:

- Fast growth without architectural oversight    
- Maintenance by multiple developers over time    
- Pressure to ship quickly    
- Lack of technical leadership or vision    

### The irony?

Despite being messy, **Big Balls of Mud often work**—they evolve to meet business needs and continue running long after cleaner systems have failed.
