> _Just because you can, doesn't mean you should._

Feature creep is when products or projects keep accumulating new features beyond their original scope. It often starts with good intentions—"Wouldn't it be nice if...?" — but ends in bloated software, confused users, and missed deadlines.

**My favorite real-world example?**  
Image editing software on digital cameras. You bought the camera to take pictures, not to crop them with a D-pad. Somewhere along the way, someone decided it _needed_ filters, and a slideshow mode. Why? Because it made for a bullet point in marketing literature, was technically possible—and nobody said no.

### Why Feature Creep Happens

- Stakeholders keep adding "just one more thing"
- Developers get excited about what's possible    
- No one enforces scope discipline    
- Fear of missing out on a competitor's feature    

### The Cost
- Scope expands → timelines slip    
- Usability suffers → core use cases get buried    
- Maintenance gets harder → more bugs, more debt    

### Then vs. Now

Back in the day, adding features meant burning another EEPROM or shipping a new CD-ROM. Now, with continuous delivery, it’s easier than ever to shovel new stuff into a product. The pressure to keep evolving is constant. But the result is often less product vision—and more product clutter.

### Preventing Feature Creep

- Define a strong core use case—and stick to it    
- Add constraints, not features    
- Involve UX early and often    
- Say "no" more than you say "yes"    

### In a Nutshell

Feature creep is scope drift in slow motion. Left unchecked, it turns simple tools into Frankenstein products. Sometimes the best feature is the one you leave out.
